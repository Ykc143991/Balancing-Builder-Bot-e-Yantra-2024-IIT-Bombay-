🚀 Project Overview
The Balancing Builder Bot (BB) is a two-wheeled self-balancing robot designed to aid in the transportation of construction materials for building sustainable infrastructure in smart cities. Our objective was to demonstrate how robotics can play a vital role in improving urban environments through efficient and intelligent automation.

We began by modeling and simulating BB in CoppeliaSim, coupled with the design of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller in MATLAB. Our simulation and control strategy helped us rank among the top 20 out of 1000+ teams, qualifying us for the hardware round.

For the hardware development, BB was built entirely from scratch:
-N20 metal gear motors with encoders enabled precise mobility.
-MPU6050 IMU, combining a gyroscope and accelerometer with sensor fusion, ensured stable orientation.
-SG90 servos powered the manipulator mechanism.
-All mechanical components were designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed.
-The control system was implemented on an Arduino Uno.
-An HC-05 Bluetooth module facilitated wireless control via smartphone.
